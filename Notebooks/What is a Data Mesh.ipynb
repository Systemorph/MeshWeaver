                "\n",
                "Data mesh is a sociotechnical approach to building a decentralized data architecture by leveraging a domain-oriented, self-serve design (in a software development perspective), and borrows Eric Evans’ theory of domain-driven design and Manuel Pais’ and Matthew Skelton’s theory of team topologies. Data mesh mainly concerns itself with the data itself, taking the data lake and the pipelines as a secondary concern. The main proposition is scaling analytical data by domain-oriented decentralization. With data mesh, the responsibility for analytical data is shifted from the central data team to the domain teams, supported by a data platform team that provides a domain-agnostic data platform. This enables a decrease in data disorder or the existence of isolated data silos, due to the presence of a centralized system that ensures the consistent sharing of fundamental principles across various nodes within the data mesh and allows for the sharing of data across different areas.

                "3. Consumers can discover data and conume under the SLOs. "
