# Tests for the hosting operator scripts.
#
# 🚨 WHAT CAN AND CANNOT BE TESTED HERE, stated plainly so nobody reads a green run as more than it
# is. These scripts drive az, kubectl, helm and psql against a live Azure estate; a test run has
# none of those, and mocking them would assert that the mocks agree with themselves. So this suite
# covers the layer that is genuinely testable AND is where the dangerous bugs live:
#
#   • argument handling — a flag silently dropped is a command run against the wrong target
#   • the REFUSALS — every guard that stands between a plan and a destructive act
#   • the ::hosting:: contract — the lines the mesh's OperatorOutput parser reads
#   • run.sh's sequencing — order, first-failure stop, and never treating an empty plan as a no-op
#
# What it does NOT cover: whether `az network dns record-set a add-record` does what we think. That
# is proven by the first real provision, and it is why the rollout is staged.
