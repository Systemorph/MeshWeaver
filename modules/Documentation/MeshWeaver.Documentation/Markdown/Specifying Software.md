Title: "Specifying Software"
Abstract: >
    Writing specification is still quite complex, and good tooling is difficult to find. 
    In many cases, mockups are created but without any real functionality. We believe that 
    specification must be written iteratively and as closely as possible to the implementation.

Writing software specifications is a complex task, and finding effective tools to support this process can be challenging. 
Traditional methods often involve creating mockups that lack real functionality, 
which can lead to misunderstandings and misalignments between stakeholders and developers. 
This article explores the importance of creating detailed specifications that are closely aligned with the actual 
implementation, ensuring that the final product meets the intended requirements.

We advocate an iterative approach and very practical approach, where the specification is 
continuously refined and updated throughout the development process. 
This method allows for the incorporation of feedback and changes, which are inevitable 
in any software project. By keeping the specification relevant and accurate, teams can 
reduce the gap between design and development.

Specifications should not only describe what the software should do but also provide 
detailed guidance on how it should be built. This includes code snippets, 
architectural diagrams, and other technical details that help bridge the gap between design 
and development. By providing this level of detail, the specification becomes 
a practical tool that developers can use to guide their work.

Modern tools and technologies play a crucial role in improving the specification process. 
Tools that support executable specifications allow teams to write specifications that can 
be directly tested and validated. This ensures that the specifications are accurate and 
helps identify issues early in the development process. By integrating these tools into the 
team's existing workflow and development environment, efficiency is maintained, and the 
specification process does not become a bottleneck.

Choosing the right tools and methodologies is essential for creating effective 
specifications. The integration of these tools with the team's workflow is crucial 
for maintaining efficiency and ensuring that the specification process is seamless. 
By leveraging modern tools and methodologies, teams can create specifications that are 
not only detailed and accurate but also actionable and testable.

In conclusion, writing practical and iterative specifications that are closely 
aligned with the implementation is essential for successful software development. 
By using modern tools and methodologies, teams can ensure that their specifications 
are detailed, accurate, and actionable. This approach helps reduce the risk of costly 
rework and delays, ensuring that the final product meets the intended requirements.
