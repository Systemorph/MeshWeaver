Title: "Vibe Coding Exposed: Can AI Build Complex Business Apps?"
Abstract: >
   Vibe coding is all the rage, but is it just for simple games, as some claim? In this video, Roland and Stefan put it to the test, 
   building a complex reinsurance pricing tool using Agent Mode and AI-powered tools. Watch them create a Mermaid diagram and run 
   its Monte Carlo simulation in seconds to prove vibe coding’s power for business applications!

## Vibe Coding – A New Take on Collaborative Programming

Vibe coding, a term introduced by Andre Karpathy on Twitter, focuses on creative collaboration and rapid iteration with AI assistance. 
In the associated video, Roland and Stefan give a hands-on demonstration of how vibe coding applies to complex software solutions, 
using a reinsurance pricing tool as their example. They approach AI tools in a similar way they would guide a junior developer—iteratively 
providing prompts, refining outputs, and shaping the final result.

### Key Insights

- **Flexible Collaboration**  
  AI agents like Copilot effectively serve as highly attentive coding partners, ready to iterate thousands of times without losing patience.

- **Interactive Visualizations**  
  Using mermaid diagrams, the video demonstrates how to transform domain models into meaningful visuals, showing relationships between pricing acceptances, sections, and loss models.

- **Context Management**  
  While large context windows are still emerging, the presenters illustrate the importance of feeding relevant project files into the AI agent. This ensures generated outputs remain aligned with your existing codebase.

- **Iterative Refinement**  
  Vibe coding is an evolving practice: short feedback loops help pinpoint issues quickly, and the AI rapidly generates code or diagrams based on precise, ongoing instructions.

### Conclusion

By weaving together domain-specific knowledge, interactive markdown, and AI-assisted coding, the video demonstrates that complex business applications—like reinsurance pricing systems—can be developed efficiently using a vibe coding approach.
