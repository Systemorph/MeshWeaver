Name: Mesh Search & Catalogs
Category: Documentation
Description: One URL-driven Search area per node — group by namespace, type, or category, drill down lazily, and embed catalogs anywhere with @@.
Icon: /static/DocContent/GUI/icon.svg
---

Every node exposes a **`Search`** layout area — a configurable catalog of its content. Instead of a
zoo of bespoke "children" / "instances" / "by-type" views, there is **one** area whose shape is
controlled entirely by the URL. Navigate to `‹node›/Search`, or embed it anywhere with `@@`, and
tune it with query parameters.

> The old dedicated `Children` area is now a thin alias of `Search?groupBy=namespace` — both share
> one implementation, so they can never drift. Prefer `Search` in new content.

## The Search area

| Reference | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `‹node›/Search` | This node's content catalog (its direct children), as a lazy **namespace tree** |
| `@@/‹node›/area/Search` | The same catalog, embedded inline in any Markdown body |
| `@@("area:Search")` | The catalog of the **current** node (relative self-reference) |

For a `NodeType` node the area instead lists the **instances** of that type; for any other node it
lists the node's own children.

---

## `?groupBy=` — how results are organised

The single most important knob. Append it to the URL (or, for an embedded area, to a standalone
page link):

| `?groupBy=` | Render mode | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `namespace` *(default)* · `ns` · `tree` | Namespace tree | Sub-namespaces become nested, collapsible folders with counts; levels load lazily on expand |
| `type` · `nodeType` | Grouped | One section per **NodeType** (Markdown, Code, Thread, …) |
| `category` · `cat` | Grouped | One section per node **Category** (falls back to NodeType when a node has none) |
| `flat` · `none` · `grid` | Flat | A single grid of thumbnail cards, no grouping |
| `hierarchy` · `hierarchical` | Hierarchical | Parent → child indentation, each root subtree kept in one cell |

Unknown or missing values fall back to the namespace tree (for a content catalog) or a hierarchical
list (for a NodeType's instances).

```
/ACME/Search                     → namespace tree of ACME's content
/ACME/Search?groupBy=type        → ACME's content grouped by NodeType
/ACME/Search?groupBy=category    → grouped by Category
/ACME/Search?groupBy=flat        → a flat card grid
```

---

## `?subtree=` — depth

By default the catalog shows only the node's **direct children**. Set `?subtree=true` (also `1`,
`yes`, `on`) to include the **entire descendant subtree** — useful with `groupBy=type` to answer
"every Story anywhere under this space", or with `groupBy=namespace` to pre-expand the whole tree.

```
/ACME/Search?groupBy=type&subtree=true     → every node under ACME, grouped by type
```

---

## Drilldown

In **namespace-tree** mode the catalog is lazy: only the direct children of the root are queried up
front, and each sub-namespace folder is queried **on expand** — so a deep space opens instantly and
you pay only for the branches you actually open. Typing in the search box switches to a subtree
search whose hits are regrouped by relative namespace. In the **flat / grouped / hierarchical**
modes, clicking a card navigates to that node (its own `Search` area, one level down).

---

## Embedding a catalog in a page

The Space welcome page ships a catalog embed; you can move or delete it, or add your own. Inside any
Markdown body (a Space body, a Markdown node, an agent definition):

```markdown
## Everything in this space

@@("area:Search")
```

The `@@` double-at prefix renders the area **inline**; a single `@` would render a link instead.
Absolute (`@@/ACME/area/Search`) and relative (`@@("area:Search")`) forms both work — see the
embed syntax in [Layout Areas](../LayoutAreas).

---

## Under the hood

The area is built on the `MeshSearchControl` — a hidden query (always applied) plus a visible query
(the search box) over the mesh, rendered through one of the modes above. `groupBy=namespace` uses a
per-level builder with child-count probes; `groupBy=type`/`category` group the result set by a node
property. The hidden query is just the [Query Syntax](/Doc/DataMesh/QuerySyntax) — e.g.
`namespace:ACME is:main -nodeType:NodeType`, extended with `scope:descendants` when `subtree` is on —
so anything you can express as a query, you can scope a catalog to.
